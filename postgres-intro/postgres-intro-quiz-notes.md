## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- Why do we use databases in Web development?
  So that we can easily store and retrieve lots of data quickly instead of saving data in files on the server.

- What is PostgreSQL and what are some alternative relational databases?
  It is a relational database that is free and open source. Some alternatives are MySQL, SQL Server by Microsoft, and Oracle.

- What are some advantages of learning a relational database?
  They are easier to store data that is related to one another without having to design a robust NoSQL database to ensure the same guarantees that relational databases have. They are also widely used and somewhat standardized so learning one will help you understand all.

- What is one way to see if PostgreSQL is running?
  By using the top command in the terminal.
