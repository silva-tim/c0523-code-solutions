## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a **breakpoint** in responsive Web design?
A breakpoint is the point that will 'break' onto a new line if the screen size is smaller.

- What is the advantage of using a percentage (_e.g._ `50%`) width instead of a fixed (_e.g._ `px`) width for a "column" class in a responsive layout?
It allows your columns to scale with the size of the screen and isn't fixed to a specific amount.

- If you introduce CSS rules for a smaller `min-width` _after_ the styles for a larger `min-width` in your style sheet, the CSS rules for the **smaller** `min-width` will "win". Why is that?
Because CSS 'cascades' so the later media queries will over take the earlier ones because they are the same specificity and lower.
