## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the purpose of variables?
  To store and manipulate data.

- How do you **declare** a variable?
  Using one of the declaration keywords (const, let, var) followed by the name of the variable.

- How do you initialize (**assign a value to**) a variable?
  By using the assignment operator (=) to assign a value to the variable.

- What characters are allowed in variable names?
  Numbers, letters, \_ or $.

- What does it mean to say that variable names are "case sensitive"?
  If you had two variables with the same name but one was capitalized then they would act independently of one another. Every reference of a variable should be case specific.

- What is the purpose of a string?
  To store words, phrases, and characters/letters.

- What is the purpose of a number?
  To store integers, or floating-point numbers for use in mathematical equations or just to store them.

- What is the purpose of a boolean?
  To store either the value true or false.

- What does the `=` operator mean in JavaScript?
  It is the assignment operator used to assign values to variables.

- How do you update the value of a variable?
  You can either reassign it using the assignment operator or you can use ++, +=, --, -= to increment or decrement the value by a specific amount.

- What is the difference between `null` and `undefined`?
  Null is a specific reference to a nonexist/invalid object or address. Undefined is just a value given to variables that haven't been assigned to a value yet.

- Why is it a good habit to include "labels" when you log values to the browser console?
  For clarity on what you are logging to the console and why.
