## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
  A function is a block of code that is executed when called. It can be used to manipulate data, perform actions, calculate answers, etc.

- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  The function keyword is used to start the definition, then an optional name of the function, then a comma seperated list of zero or more parameters, then the start of the code block ({), an optional return statement, and a (}) to finish the code block.

- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  The functions name is used to call the function and this is followed by a list of comma seperated arguments that are sent to the function.

- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
  A function call is the execution of a function whereas a function definition is just the code that tells the function what to do. A call doesn't need the 'function' keyword but a definition does.

- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
  A parameter is the name of a placeholder variable used in the definition of a function. An argument is the actual variable that gets passed into the function when the function is called.

- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  Parameters are useful when you want to pass information into the function but you don't know what that information is yet or you know that information could change between executions of the function.

- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
  Return statements can produce a value to be used in the program and they also prevent any more of the code in the function to run which effectively ends the function.
