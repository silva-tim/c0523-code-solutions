## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is Webpack?
  Webpack is a bundler that bundles JavaScript/modules.

- What is the advantage of using Webpack (or a similar bundler)?
  They bundle all your code so they can easily be transferred/downloaded.

- What is Babel?
  Babel is a JavaScript transpiler.

- What is the advantage of using Babel (or a similar transpiler)?
  It allows developers to write code in more modern versions of JavaScript / other types of high-level JavaScript based languages and transpile that code so it can be used in browsers that may not have support for these other versions/types of JavaScript. They also can obfuscate your code which makes it harder for others to determine what the code is doing.
