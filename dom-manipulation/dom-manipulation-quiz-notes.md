## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the `className` property of element objects?
  The property that gets and sets the class attribute of an element.

- How do you update the text within an element using JavaScript?
  By using the .textContent = ... property.

- Is the `event` parameter of an event listener callback always useful?
  No not always, sometimes it just exists and is not used in the callback function.

- Would this assignment be simpler or more complicated if we didn't use a variable to keep track of the number of clicks?
  It would be more complicated because we would have no idea how many times the button has been clicked.

- Why is storing information about a program in variables better than only storing it in the DOM?
  So that we don't have to keep querying for the information everytime we want to interact with it, instead we can just interact with the variable.
