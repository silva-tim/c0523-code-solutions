  Don't have to use state, JSX is a bit cleaner, easier to implement.

- What are some advantages of using controlled components?
  Use state which can be helpful, also don't have to get the inputs from the DOM and instead can retrieve it through state. All the logic is in React so you don't have to manually change the DOM.
