## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the purpose of a loop?
  To repeat a specific action/block of code a certain amount of times.

- What is the purpose of a **condition** expression in a loop?
  To determine if the code should run based on the truthyness of the condition.

- What does "iteration" mean in the context of loops?
  It means how many times it executes the code.

- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `while` loop get evaluated?
  At the beginning of every new iteration before it starts executing the code.

- _When_ does the **initialization** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  At the very beginning before the first iteration of code.

- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  At the start of every new iteration of the code.

- _When_ does the **final** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  At the end of each iteration of the code.

- Besides a `return` statement, which exits its entire function block, which keyword exits a loop before its **condition** expression evaluates to `false`?
  Using the break keyword we can exit the loop at any point.

- What does the `++` increment operator do?
  It increments its operand and returns the value either before or after the incremenet depending on where the operator is in relation to the operand.

- How do you iterate through the keys of an object?
  You can use a for...in loop to iterate through all the keys of an object.
